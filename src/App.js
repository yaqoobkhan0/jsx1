        handbags, accessories and more.That "more" is providing the very best cutomer service, customer
        experience, and company culture. We aim to inspire the world by showing it's possible to simultaneously
        deliver happiness to customers, employees, vendors, shareholders, and the community in a long-term, sustainble way.
